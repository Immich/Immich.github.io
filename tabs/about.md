# Hi there! 🙂

I'm Mitch (she/her). 👩‍💻 I graduated as a computer scientist, and I've been working for the last 5 years using Machine Learning to solve real world problems in areas such as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Chemometrics.

### Community

I love collaborating and participating with Tech communities and I co-created three of them:

1. [Hackrobots](https://www.meetup.com/HackrobotsMX/) focused in robotics.
2. [AI Learners](https://twitter.com/ai_learners) focused in AI/ML/DL.
3. [Technolatinas](https://twitter.com/Technolatinas) focused on breaking the gender gap in Tech.

### Work

Currently, I work as a MLE at [BÜCHI Labortechnik](https://www.buchi.com/en). My day to day consists in solving scientific and engineering challenges, building data pipelines and putting ML models into production.

### Topics I'm into

* Reproducible Machine Learning
* Data Engineering
* MLOps
* Algorithmic Fairness
* ML in Production
